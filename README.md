This is a somewhat "lighter" version of KORAL, a two-temperature, radiative GRMHD code written by Aleksander Sadowski

WARNING: old problem definitions are listed, but files have been removed as they have not been tested on the updated koral_lite code.
Please contact achael@princeton.edu if you would like to request that they be restored to the code
